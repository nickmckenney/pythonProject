## Issues I ran into

#### Trying to implement a GUI into python was very difficult. I had multiple problems with not correctly importing tkinter. The issue is still not resolved. Steps I took to resolve this issue were 
1. Reinstalling python
2. Reinstalling tkinter using sudo app-get
3. Using python3 to import tkinter
